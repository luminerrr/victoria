### Simplified Requirements for Staff API

#### **Scenario:**
The library management system needs an API that allows staff members to manage the book inventory (add, update, or delete books). This API should only be accessible by users who have a valid JWT (JSON Web Token). No complex role checks are required; if the user has a valid token, they can access the API.

---

### **API Design: Manage Book Inventory**

#### **Endpoint:** `POST /api/staff/manage_books`
- **Description:** This API allows authenticated users to manage books in the library’s inventory by adding, updating, or deleting books.
- **Access Requirement:** Only users with a valid JWT can access this API.

---

### **Requirements:**

1. **JWT Validation:**
   - Only users with a valid JWT can access this API.
   - If the user does not have a valid token, they will not be able to use this API.

2. **Actions:**
   - **Add a book:** Add a new book to the library's inventory.
   - **Update a book:** Modify details of an existing book (such as title, author, or quantity).
   - **Delete a book:** Remove a book from the system if it is not currently borrowed by any patrons.

3. **Basic Validations:**
   - For adding or updating a book, all required fields (title, author, quantity) must be provided.
   - For deleting a book, the book must not be currently borrowed by any patron.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - **If the user has a valid JWT:** They will be able to manage the library’s books (add, update, or delete).
   - **If the user does not have a valid JWT:** They will receive an error message saying they are not authorized to access the API.

### **Examples:**

#### **Add a Book Request:**
```json
{
  "action": "add",
  "book": {
    "title": "Effective Java",
    "author": "Joshua Bloch",
    "isbn": "9780134685991",
    "quantity": 5
  }
}
```

#### **Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Book added successfully."
}
```

---

#### **Update a Book Request:**
```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "book_id": 1,
  "book": {
    "title": "Clean Code",
    "author": "Robert C. Martin",
    "quantity": 10
  }
}
```

#### **Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Book updated successfully."
}
```

---

#### **Delete a Book Request:**
```json
{
  "action": "delete",
  "book_id": 1
}
```

#### **Expected Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "message": "Book deleted successfully."
}
```

---

### **Unauthorized Access Example:**

#### **When JWT is Invalid or Missing:**
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unauthorized access. Please provide a valid token."
  }
  ```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Access:** Only users with a valid JWT token can access this API.
- **Actions:** Users can add, update, or delete books.
- **Simple Validation:** All required fields must be provided, and books cannot be deleted if they are currently borrowed.
- **JWT Handling:** The system will check for a valid JWT before allowing access to the API.
